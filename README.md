# iRporter
Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention

## Project On Pivatal Tracker
The url is https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2227847

## GitHub Pages
The site is hosted on git hub pages under the url
https://paphra.github.io/iReporter

## Access:
The inner site is not accessible to the outside world because the code for the authentication is not yet made.
**Signup** is accessible
**Signin** is accessible
**About** is accessible
### To access other pages:
*https://paphra.github.io/iReporter/profile.html* for the profile [User Profile]

*https://paphra.github.io/iReporter/admin.html* for the Admin page.

Others like the create, details, edit, change status, and view all are then accessed using different buttons

## Next Steps
The next thing would be to design the code to enable sigin and signup process.
I have made it in a way that the js framework shall be used for form validation/authentication and loading of data.
